Unit 12 Homework: Mission to Mars

This project queries several websites for data about Mars. Data is first scraped using python and then saved to Mongo database before pulled into the index.html page for display and summary. Unfortunately, an issue with the Mongo connection prevents the index.html page from loading. Will aim to resubmit before the end of the course. 

##Update
After several attempted modification, the flask app still does not work correctly.
